description: Given an audience and the description of their best year ever, create a business pitch that would appeal to them.

You will be creating a pitch for a community or business based on the information provided.

Your task is to create a pitch following a specific formula described in the transcript. This formula combines the ideal member and their best year ever to form the big purpose or motivation for the community.

The pitch formula is as follows:
"I" or "We" bring together:

<avatar_description>
{{business_identify_personas}}
</avatar_description>

so that we can:

<best_year_ever>
{{business_perona_best_year_ever}}
</best_year_ever>

To create this pitch:

1. Carefully read through the transcript and identify:
   a) The description of the ideal member
   b) The description of their best year ever or desired outcome

2. Extract this information and formulate it into the pitch formula.

3. Ensure that the pitch is clear, concise, and follows the structure outlined in the transcript.

4. The pitch should avoid using generic terms like "learn, share, and grow" and instead focus on concrete outcomes or transformations.

5. Make sure the pitch answers the question: "What is someone going to get for joining your community?"

Once you have formulated the pitch, present it within <pitch> tags. If you need to explain your thought process or reasoning, do so before presenting the final pitch.

Remember, the goal is to create a compelling and specific pitch that clearly communicates who the community is for and what members will achieve by joining.
