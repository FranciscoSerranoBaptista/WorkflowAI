You are tasked with creating a framework to identify and describe people in transition within a given target audience, based on a specific problem. This framework will help uncover potential ideal members for a community or product focused on addressing the given problem.

Here is the problem you need to address:
<problem>
{{PROBLEM}}
</problem>

And here is the target audience:
<target_audience>
{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}
</target_audience>

Follow these steps to identify and describe people in transition:

1. Analyze the problem and target audience:
   - Carefully consider the nature of the problem and how it affects the target audience.
   - Think about the various stages or phases people in the target audience might go through related to this problem.

2. Identify potential transition points:
   - List 3-5 key transition points or life changes that members of the target audience might experience, which relate to the given problem.
   - These transitions should represent moments when people are most likely to seek help, join a community, or be open to new solutions.

3. Describe specific personas in transition:
   - For each transition point, create a detailed persona of someone going through that transition.
   - Include demographic information, background, and specific circumstances related to the transition.

4. Explain their motivations and pain points:
   - For each persona, describe:
     a. Their primary motivations related to the problem and transition
     b. The main challenges or pain points they face during this transition
     c. What they hope to achieve or how they want their situation to improve

5. Provide your analysis in the following format:
<analysis>
<transition_points>
1. [First transition point]
2. [Second transition point]
3. [Third transition point]
[Add more if applicable]
</transition_points>

<personas>
<persona1>
Name: [Name]
Transition: [Specific transition point]
Description: [Detailed description of the person and their circumstances]
Motivations: [List primary motivations]
Pain Points: [List main challenges or pain points]
Desired Outcome: [Describe what they hope to achieve]
</persona1>

<persona2>
[Follow the same structure as persona1]
</persona2>

<persona3>
[Follow the same structure as persona1]
</persona3>

[Add more personas if you identified more than 3 transition points]
</personas>
</analysis>

Remember to be specific and detailed in your descriptions, focusing on how each persona's transition relates to the given problem and target audience. Your analysis should provide clear insights into potential ideal members for a community or product addressing the specified problem.
