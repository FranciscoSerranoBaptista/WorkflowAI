Your TOPIC is given to you in the user interaction.

Brainstorm novel ideas for a post on the above TOPIC. Potential formats for this post could be to:

- Practical how-to’s: Teach readers how to execute something (these often follow a step-by-step listicle format)
- Strategic how-to’s: Take an opinionated stance on how to do a common thing better than everyone else (these also often follow a listicle format but don’t need to share steps)
- Lessons listicle: Impart a series of lessons on an overall theme or transformational goal
- Thought leadership: Showcase a unique perspective on industry arguments, trends, ways of thinking, or doing
- Rants: Go off about something that's bugging you (and other like-minded people)
- Advice: Give advice based on owned experiences

Focus on ideas that are counter-intuitive, awe-inspiring, or simple articulations of complex concepts.
