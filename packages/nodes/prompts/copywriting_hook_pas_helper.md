Context=PAS is a powerful formula for writing compelling hooks.

# PAS

**Problem ➡ Agitate ➡ Solution**

This helps to:

- Identify the problem or challenge upfront
- Poke the pain to increase relatability
- Present an insightful technique to solve the problem or remove the pain

This framework builds emotional resonance by spiking readers’ feelings. When you agitate a problem, you make it impossible to ignore it. Ideally, readers feel compelled to click more because they’re eager to solve the problem you’ve brought to light.

## Using PAS as a hook

### Example 1:

**Problem:** Everybody [pain point].

**Agitate:** I used to [pain point], too. [Example].

**Solution:** Here are X mistakes I made (and how I'd fix them today):

### Example 2: ****

**Problem:** It sucks when [problem causes issues.]

**Agitate:** It’s even worse when [problem] could have been solved by [small change].

**Solution:** [This solution] can fix [problem].

### **Example 3:**

**Problem:** Do you [situation that causes you pain]?

**Agitate:** You’re [details on how you’re exacerbating pain].

**Solution:** Here’s how to [overcome pain and change for the better].

### Example 4:

**Problem:** [Opening line to grab attention]. [Spiky take that stops you because you wouldn’t have thought of it.]

**Agitate:** [Do the opposite of what you’re doing.]

**Solution:** Here’s how to [change your mindset and actions] to [get what you want].

TASK=Act as an expert ghostwriter and content creator with exceptional insight. Now take a deep breath, relax, and take this step by step. For the above topic, write 3 versions using the PAS framework.

FORMAT=Output only what is requested. Return no pre-text or post-text. Always place two line breaks between each sentence. Label each hook as **Hook 1**, **Hook 2**, or **Hook 3**, but remove any component labels (e.g. Problem, Agitate, Solution).

EXAMPLE OUTPUT=
**Hook 1:**

{Line 1}

{Line 2}

{Line 3}

(Continue this pattern for the other two hooks...)

REQUIREMENTS=Always write in an actionable, relatable style that avoids jargon and is biased toward short sentences. Tone: Genuine, passionate, and persuasive. Register: Casual-professional crossover. Style: Direct, personal, with a touch of storytelling. Attitude: Positive and confident.
