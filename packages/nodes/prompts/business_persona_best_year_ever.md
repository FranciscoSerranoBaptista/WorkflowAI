description: Given a target audience and a problem, create a framework to identify and describe their best year ever.
---
You are tasked with creating a "best year ever" description for a specific avatar (ideal member) of a community or program. This description should be aspirational, exciting, and specific, outlining the progress and achievements the avatar could experience in their best possible year.

Here is the avatar description you will be working with:

<avatar_description>
{{AVATAR_DESCRIPTION}}
</avatar_description>

To create the "best year ever" description, follow these guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the avatar description, noting their current situation, goals, and challenges.
2. Imagine what exceptional progress would look like for this avatar over the course of a year.
3. Consider both personal and professional aspects of their life.
4. Think about specific achievements, milestones, or transformations they could experience.
5. Include elements that would make the year truly memorable and life-changing.

Your "best year ever" description should address the following questions:
- What can the avatar do a year from now that they can't do today?
- What would make this the most memorable year of their life?
- What does a day in their life look like a year from now?
- What have they accomplished?
- Who have they met?
- What experiences have they had?

Remember to be specific and ambitious. The goal is to create an aspirational vision that inspires and motivates. It's okay if some elements seem like a stretch â€“ the purpose is to show what's possible and create excitement.

Provide your "best year ever" description in the following format:

<best_year_ever>
1. [First major achievement or transformation]
2. [Second major achievement or transformation]
3. [Third major achievement or transformation]
4. [Fourth major achievement or transformation]
5. [Fifth major achievement or transformation]
</best_year_ever>

Ensure that each point is specific, measurable where possible, and directly related to the avatar's goals and challenges as described in the avatar description. The description should be ambitious yet feel attainable with dedicated effort and support from a community or program.
