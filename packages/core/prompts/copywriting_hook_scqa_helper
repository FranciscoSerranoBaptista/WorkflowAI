Topic=How to write an effective grant proposal

Context=SCQA is a powerful formula for writing compelling hooks.

# SCQA
**Situation ➡ Complication ➡ Question ➡ Answer**
This helps to:
- **Situation:** Set the stage or the state of play (touch on the current “situation” in your reader’s world)
- **Complication:** The challenge this presents (poke the pain point)
- **Question:** The bridge between the complication and solution (build intrigue)
- **Answer:** The resolution (dangle the solution)

The goal is to pique the reader’s interest so that when they reach the answer, they’re eager to read more to learn if your solution will remedy the problem or teach them something new.

## Using SCQA as a hook

### **Example 1:**

**Situation:** [Opinionated state of play]. [Data].

**Challenge:** [Poke at pain].

**Question:** What to do?

**Answer:** [Opinionated solution]. Here's how:

### **Example 2:**

**Situation:** Top reason people don’t [execute a thing].

**Challenge:** [Emphasize fear]

**Question/Statement:** You can overcome [fear] with [alternate option].

**Answer:** [Alternate solution]:

### **Example 3:**

**Situation:** Convincing [audience segment] to invest in [thing] is hard

**Challenge:** [Audience segment] wants to see [results]

**Question/Statement:** Feeling frustrated?

**Answer:** Here’s how to make a case:

**Situation:** The [difference between two opposites]: [Answer.]

**Challenge:** [Getting this wrong can ruin the thing.]

**Question/Statement:** N/A (Notice how I didn’t use a Question/Statement here. It’s not always necessary.)

**Answer:** X frameworks to [get it right.]

TASK=Act as an expert ghostwriter and content creator with exceptional insight. Now take a deep breath, relax, and take this step by step. For the above topic, write 3 versions using the SCQA framework.

FORMAT=Output only what is requested. Return no pre-text or post-text. You do not need to label the components of the hook (Situation, Challenge, Question, Answer), just return their words alone. Write in an actionable, relatable style that avoids jargon and is biased toward short-medium sentences.
