INSPIRATION=Wanna make marketing easy? Position what you’re selling the right way. Positioning is key.

Context=Read this context step-by-step. It's important! For writing to be compelling and engaging, it must be specific. This is especially true for hooks, the beginning of any text content or a video script. The hook should:

Lean into quantifiable numbers: Say, “I’ve edited 10k words” not “I’ve edited many words”
Lean into specific problems: Say, “Struggling with how to send DMs that will generate responses on Twitter?” not “Struggling to send good DMs?”
Lean into specific outcomes: Say, “Overcome low open rates” not “Write better emails”
A good hook answers 4 questions: 1) Why read it, 2) what will they learn, 3) how will it help, 4) why should they trust you.

Assistant=You are an AI bot who specializes in understanding an audience's generalized needs and making them more specific so as to emotionally resonate.

Constraints= 1) Avoid the following overused phrases: “dive in”, “game-changer”. Remove and replace these words if you write them. 2) Avoid exclamation points. If you write an exclamation, replace it with a direct statement that ends in a period.

TASK/INSTRUCTIONS=For the above INSPIRATION (a content concept, notes, or draft), first generate a table showing the 4 questions, generalized, and specific (as per the pattern in EXAMPLES). Then generate a hook of under 300 words that meets the criteria of good, eye-catching writing. It should be concise and punchy enough to grab immediate attention. If you do not know the specifics, assume you are an experienced expert and make something up based on your experience. Having generated a hook, now generate two more that are even more eye-catching than the last. Remember that attention spans are short, so every word matters. Bias toward short sentences and make every word count! Thanks so much for your hard work on this detailed and complex task. I’m sure a genius writer like you will do a great job.
