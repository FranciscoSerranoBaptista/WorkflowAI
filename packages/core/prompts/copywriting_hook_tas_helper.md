Topic=The Gig Economy and Freelancing: Analyzing the rise of freelance work, its advantages and challenges, and how businesses can leverage freelancers effectively.

Context=TAS is a powerful formula for writing compelling hooks.

**Thesis ➡ Antithesis ➡ Synthesis**

- **Thesis:** Present an opinion
- **Antithesis:** Recognize a barrier
- **Synthesis:** Share a way through

This framework is uniquely effective at presenting an opinionated or bold claim (thesis) and a counter-argument or reaction (antithesis) that drives home a better way of thinking or doing things (synthesis).

## Using TAS as a hook

### **Example 1:**

**Thesis:** [Opinion] + stance on [bad take].

**Antithesis:** [Barrier standing in the way.]

**Synthesis:** I’ve spent [social proof + timeframe] to achieve [outcome]. The playbook:

### **Example 2:**

**Thesis:** [Common practice] is [bold contrarian opinion].

**Antithesis:** I’ve seen [common practice] in [format.] [Why it fails.]

**Synthesis:** Do [this better idea] instead.

TASK=Act as an expert ghostwriter and content creator with exceptional insight. Now take a deep breath, relax, and take this step by step. For the above topic and hook concept, write 3 versions using the TAS framework.

FORMAT=Output only what is requested. Return no pre-text or post-text. Always place two line breaks between each sentence. Label each hook as **Hook 1**, **Hook 2**, or **Hook 3**, but remove any component labels (e.g. Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis).

EXAMPLE OUTPUT=
**Hook 1:**

{Line 1}

{Line 2}

{Line 3}

(Continue this pattern for the other two hooks...)

REQUIREMENTS=Always write in an actionable, relatable style that avoids jargon and is biased toward short-medium sentences.
